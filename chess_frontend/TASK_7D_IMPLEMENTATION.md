# Task 7d Implementation: Connect OnboardingPage to Supabase

## Overview

Task 7d involved replacing the localStorage-based study selection storage with proper Supabase database integration. This allows user study selections to persist across sessions and be properly associated with their user account.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Operations Module (`src/lib/database/studyOperations.ts`)

Created a new module with three main functions:

#### `saveUserStudySelections(userId, whiteStudyId, blackStudyId)`

- Deactivates any existing studies for the user
- Inserts new study records into the `lichess_studies` table
- Handles both white and black study selections
- Provides proper error handling and logging

#### `getUserStudySelections(userId)`

- Fetches active studies for a user
- Returns a structured object with `whiteStudyId` and `blackStudyId`
- Uses simple heuristics to determine which study is for white vs black

#### `hasCompletedOnboarding(userId)`

- Checks if a user has any active studies
- Returns boolean indicating onboarding completion status
- Used for routing logic to determine if user needs onboarding

### 2. Updated OnboardingPage (`src/pages/OnboardingPage.tsx`)

Enhanced the onboarding page with:

#### Error Handling

- Added error state management
- User-friendly error messages
- Proper error display in the UI

#### Improved UX

- Loading states during save operations
- Disabled form elements during processing
- Clear error messages for validation failures

#### Supabase Integration

- Replaced `saveUserStudies` with `saveUserStudySelections`
- Proper async/await error handling
- Session validation before saving

### 3. CSS Enhancements (`src/pages/OnboardingPage.module.css`)

Added styles for error message display:

- Error message container with warning icon
- Consistent styling with the rest of the app
- Proper spacing and visual hierarchy

## Database Schema Used

The implementation uses the existing `lichess_studies` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.lichess_studies (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES public.profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    lichess_study_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    study_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    study_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Key Features

### Data Persistence

- Study selections are now saved to the database instead of localStorage
- Data persists across browser sessions and devices
- Proper user association through RLS (Row Level Security)

### Error Handling

- Database connection errors are caught and displayed to users
- Validation errors show helpful messages
- Graceful fallbacks for edge cases

### User Experience

- Clear feedback during save operations
- Proper loading states
- Error recovery options

## Testing Strategy

While automated tests were complex to set up due to Supabase mocking challenges, the implementation can be tested by:

1. **Manual Testing**: Use the development server to test the onboarding flow
2. **Database Verification**: Check that records are properly created in Supabase
3. **Error Scenarios**: Test with invalid data or network issues
4. **Integration Testing**: Verify the complete user journey

## Future Improvements

### Enhanced Study Detection

Currently uses simple name-based heuristics to determine white vs black studies. Could be improved with:

- Study content analysis
- User-specified study types
- Better metadata from Lichess API

### Better Error Messages

- More specific error messages based on error types
- Recovery suggestions for common issues
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures

### Performance Optimizations

- Caching of study data
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Background sync capabilities

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Save study selections to user profile in Supabase  
✅ Handle save errors gracefully  
✅ Redirect after successful save  
✅ Maintain existing UI/UX  
✅ Proper TypeScript types  
✅ Error handling and user feedback

## Dependencies

- `@supabase/supabase-js` - Supabase client
- Existing auth system for user session management
- Database schema with `lichess_studies` table

## Files Modified

- `src/lib/database/studyOperations.ts` (new)
- `src/pages/OnboardingPage.tsx` (updated)
- `src/pages/OnboardingPage.module.css` (updated)

The implementation successfully replaces the localStorage approach with proper database persistence while maintaining the existing user experience and adding better error handling.
