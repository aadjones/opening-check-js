# Debugging Plan - June 2, 2025

## Implementing a Backend Proxy for CORS Issues

- [x] **Step 1: Install HTTPX**
  - Add `httpx` to your `requirements.txt` file.
  - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the package.

- [x] **Step 2: Add Proxy Endpoint**
  - Open `main.py` in the `chess_backend` directory.
  - Add a new endpoint `/proxy/{path:path}` that forwards requests to the Lichess API using `httpx`.

- [x] **Step 3: Configure CORS**
  - Ensure the CORS middleware in `main.py` allows requests from your frontend.
  - Update the `origins` list if necessary to include all frontend URLs.

- [x] **Step 4: Update Frontend**
  - Modify the frontend code to send requests to the new proxy endpoint instead of directly to the Lichess API.

- [x] **Step 5: Test the Proxy**
  - Run the backend server and test the proxy endpoint to ensure it forwards requests correctly.
  - Check for any errors or issues in the console and logs.

- [x] **Step 6: Debug and Refine**
  - Address any issues encountered during testing.
  - Refine the proxy implementation as needed to handle edge cases or improve performance.

- [x] **Step 7: Document Changes**
  - Update any relevant documentation to reflect the new proxy setup.
  - Ensure team members are informed of the changes and how to use the proxy.
