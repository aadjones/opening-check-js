# Quick Setup Instructions

## ✅ What's Done
- [x] Supabase project created
- [x] Database schema set up
- [x] Supabase client libraries installed
- [x] Client configuration files created
- [x] Environment variables configured and tested
- [x] Vitest testing framework set up

## 🎉 Setup Complete!

Your Supabase integration is working perfectly! The tests confirm:
- ✅ Backend connection successful
- ✅ Frontend connection successful  
- ✅ Database tables accessible
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### Run Tests
```bash
cd chess_frontend

# Run all tests
npm run test:run

# Run with visual UI (recommended)
npm run test:ui

# Watch mode for development
npm run test
```

### Test Results
- **Unit tests**: Always pass (use mocked Supabase)
- **Integration tests**: Pass when environment variables are set
- **6 tests total**: All should be passing ✅

## 📁 Files Created
- `chess_frontend/src/lib/supabase.ts` - Frontend Supabase client with TypeScript types
- `chess_backend/supabase_client.py` - Backend Supabase client with connection testing
- `chess_frontend/src/test/` - Complete test suite with unit and integration tests
- `chess_frontend/README-TESTING.md` - Comprehensive testing documentation
- `planning_docs/supabase_schema.sql` - Database schema
- `planning_docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md` - Detailed setup guide

## 🚀 Next Steps - Ready to Build!

Now that your foundation is solid, you can choose what to build next:

### Option 1: Authentication System 🔐
- Build login/signup components
- Implement Lichess OAuth
- User profile management

### Option 2: Basic Dashboard 📊  
- Create main app layout

## 💡 Development Workflow

1. **Write tests first** (we have the framework ready!)
2. **Use `npm run test:ui`** for the best development experience
3. **Check both frontend and backend** when making changes
4. **Environment variables are secure** (not committed to git)

## 🛠️ Useful Commands

```bash
# Frontend development
cd chess_frontend
npm run dev          # Start dev server
npm run test:ui      # Run tests with UI
npm run build        # Build for production

# Backend development  
cd chess_backend
python supabase_client.py    # Test Supabase connection
python main.py              # Start FastAPI server

# Testing
cd chess_frontend
npm run test                # Watch mode
npm run test:run           # Run once
npm run test:coverage      # With coverage report
```
