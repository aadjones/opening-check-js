# OutOfBook Revised Implementation Plan

## Overview
Breaking down the remaining work into small, isolated, testable task loops. Each task should be completable in 1-2 hours and have clear success criteria. This plan focuses on wiring up the existing frontend components and implementing the backend functionality described in the revised vision.

## Architecture Decision: Sync System

**Key Changes**:
- Implement timestamp-based game syncing
- Add review status tracking
- Add basic insights generation
- Add prep score tracking
- Add simple sync preferences

## Task Loop Categories
- **BACKEND**: Server and database functionality
- **SYNC**: Game synchronization system
- **INTEGRATION**: Connecting frontend to backend
- **DATA**: Data models and transformations

- [X] **Success Criteria**:
  - [X] Calculates weekly scores (held prep vs deviations)
  - [X] Updates scores on new games
  - [X] Basic score display
- [X] **Tests**: Score calculation logic
- [X] **Estimated Time**: 1 hour

  - [X] Database schema supports both user and opponent deviations
  - [ ] LastGameSummaryWidget shows real data
  - [ ] PrepScoreWidget displays current scores
  - [ ] GamesList shows real games with status
- [X] **Tests**: Pure logic tests for deviation detection
- [ ] **Estimated Time**: 2 hours
