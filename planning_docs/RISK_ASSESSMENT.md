# Risk Assessment & Mitigation

## Technical Risks

### High Impact, High Probability
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Lichess API Rate Limiting | High | High | Implement intelligent caching, request batching, fallback modes |
| OAuth Integration Complexity | Medium | High | Use proven libraries, extensive testing, fallback authentication |
| Database Performance at Scale | High | Medium | Query optimization, indexing strategy, connection pooling |

### High Impact, Medium Probability
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Lichess API Changes | High | Medium | Monitor API announcements, maintain backward compatibility |
| Chess Engine Accuracy | High | Medium | Extensive testing with known positions, user feedback loops |
| Spaced Repetition Algorithm Issues | Medium | Medium | Use proven algorithms (SM-2), A/B testing for improvements |

### Medium Impact, Various Probability
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| User Study Privacy Issues | Medium | Low | Clear privacy policy, user consent, data minimization |

## Business Risks

### Market Risks
- **Competition from ChessBase/Chessable**: Differentiate through specific deviation focus
- **Limited Target Market**: Expand to coaching tools, different skill levels
- **Seasonal Usage Patterns**: Prepare for tournament cycles, summer lulls

### Legal Risks
- **GDPR Compliance**: Implement privacy by design, consent management
- **Terms of Service with Lichess**: Ensure compliance with API terms
- **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive data, regular security audits

## Mitigation Timeline
- **Week 1**: Implement rate limiting and caching
- **Week 2**: Set up monitoring and alerting
- **Week 4**: Complete security audit
- **Week 8**: Stress test with synthetic data
- **Week 12**: Legal review and compliance check
